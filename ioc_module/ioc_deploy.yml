# This is for dev, and doesn't include using 'cram' and deploying a component to a 
# deployment location ($APP or $PHYSICS_TOP or $TOOLS/script or $PYDYM etc.)
# Process in detail: https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/LCLSControls/CD+-+Deployment+Stage
# This is a 'master playbook' that would call other ioc playbooks based off
# what is needed, mainly initial / normal deployment

- hosts: all
# All hosts are availble to use, but user can run this playbook on specific
